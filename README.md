**Status: experimental, unstable, under development.**

This is an experimental multi-format mod player engine written in Rust, addressing the
main problems found during the development of libxmp: error handling, player accuracy,
maintainability.

Current mixing is using code chunks borrowed from libxmp to verify if the players are
correctly implemented. Sound quality will be improved over time.
